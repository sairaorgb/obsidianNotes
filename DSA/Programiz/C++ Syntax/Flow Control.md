#### C++ relational operators
A relational operator is used to check the relationship between two operands.
Examples include == , != , > , < , >= , <=

#### C++ logical operators
We use logical operators to check whether an expression is **true** or **false**.
Examples include && , || , !

#### C++ If - Else
It acts on the basis of boolean expression evaluated.
The Statements can be if , else or else if
All the statements can be nested into another following syntactic rules.

#### C++ Loops

**For loops**
``` c++
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // body of-loop 
}
```
 **Range based loops** 
 ``` C++
for (variable : collection) {
    // body of loop
}
```
**While loops**
```c++
while (condition) {
    // body of the loop
}
```
**Do-while loops**
``` C++
do {
   // body of loop;
}
while (condition);
```
> break  statement is used to kill a loop when a particular condition is met

> continue statement is used to skip the current iteration 

#### Switch case 

``` c++
switch (expression)  {
    case constant1:
        // code to be executed if 
        break;

    case constant2:
        // code to be executed if
        break;
        .
        .
    default:
        // code to be executed if
}
```

> Ternary Operator 

``` c++
condition ? expression1 : expression2;
```
 
  Ternary operator can also be nested but care is need to be taken.
